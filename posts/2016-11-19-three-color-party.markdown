title:  Towards the Three Color Party

Although "communitarian populism" has the benefit of engaging with existing policial philosophy debates, it's very catchy when it comes to describing a political party.  There are lots of European parties with cool names - the Pirate Party, the 5 Star Movement, Podemos, etc.  So what would a Peircian-inspired communitarian populist political party be called?  I propose the *Three Color Party,* as both a nod to Peirce's triadomania as well as a serious reference to policy.  

From the communitiarian perspective, the main trichotomy would be "market, state, society."  The "society" component has many names.  It is "civic" in civic republicanism.  It is "commons" in the Commons Transition.  It is "community" in communitarianism.
